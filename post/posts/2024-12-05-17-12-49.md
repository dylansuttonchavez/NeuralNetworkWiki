## **Introduction**

Navigation is a fundamental skill for any organism with vision, playing a crucial role in survival by allowing agents to locate food, shelter, and avoid predators. In order to successfully navigate environments, smart agents primarily rely on vision, allowing them to construct representations of their surroundings to assess distances and capture landmarks in the environment, all useful for planning a navigation route.

Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promising results in various computer vision tasks, including image and video generation. Researchers from Meta AI, New York University, and Berkeley AI Research have introduced a novel approach called Navigation World Models (NWM), which leverages diffusion models to predict future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions.

NWM is a scalable diffusion model trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, capturing complex environment dynamics. By employing a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT) architecture, NWM can efficiently scale up to 1 billion parameters, enabling it to plan navigation trajectories by simulating potential paths and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal.

In this article, we will explore the key concepts behind Navigation World Models, their applications in visual navigation tasks, and the advantages they offer over traditional supervised navigation policies. We will also delve into the Conditional Diffusion Transformer architecture and its efficient scaling properties. Additionally, we will provide code examples and mathematical concepts to aid in understanding the underlying techniques.

## **Main Topics**

### **Navigation World Models**

Navigation World Models (NWM) are diffusion models trained to predict future visual representations based on past observations and navigation actions. The core idea behind NWM is to learn a stochastic mapping from previous latent observation(s) and actions to future latent state representations.

Mathematically, the NWM aims to learn a function F, which maps the past latent observations s_τ and action a_τ to the future latent state s_(τ+1):

```
s_i = enc(x_i)
s_(τ+1) ~ F(s_(τ+1) | s_τ, a_τ)
```

Here, `enc` is a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder that converts the input image `x_i` into a latent representation `s_i`. The function `F` is implemented using a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), which we will discuss in the next section.

During training, NWM is exposed to a diverse collection of egocentric videos and associated navigation actions from both human and robotic agents. This allows the model to capture complex environment dynamics and learn to predict future visual representations accurately.

After training, NWM can be used for various visual navigation tasks, such as:

1. **Standalone Planning**: Given an initial observation and a goal image, NWM can plan a trajectory by simulating potential navigation plans and evaluating whether they reach the desired goal.
2. **Ranking Trajectories**: Assuming access to an existing navigation policy, NWM can rank sampled trajectories by simulating them and selecting the best ones based on their similarity to the goal image.
3. **Imagination in Unknown Environments**: By leveraging its learned visual priors, NWM can imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.

### **Conditional Diffusion Transformer**

The Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT) is a novel architecture introduced in this work, designed to efficiently scale diffusion models for visual navigation tasks. CDiT is a temporally autoregressive transformer model that utilizes a specialized attention mechanism to condition on past observations and actions.

1. **Attention Layer**: This layer focuses only on tokens from the target frame being denoised, constraining the attention to reduce computational complexity.
2. **Cross Attention Layer**: This layer allows every query token from the current target frame to attend to tokens from past frames, contextualizing the representations using skip connections.
3. **Action Conditioning**: Continuous actions, such as translation, rotation, and time shift, are mapped to sine-cosine features and combined into a single vector using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This vector is then used to modulate the layer normalization outputs and attention layers, conditioning the model on the actions.

The CDiT block's computational complexity is linear with respect to the number of context frames, allowing it to scale efficiently for models trained up to 1 billion parameters across diverse environments and embodiments. Compared to a standard Diffusion Transformer (DiT), CDiT requires 4× fewer FLOPs while achieving better future prediction results.

### **Planning with World Models**

One of the key advantages of Navigation World Models is their ability to plan navigation trajectories by simulating potential paths and evaluating their outcomes. This is achieved through an optimization process that minimizes an energy function based on the perceptual similarity between the predicted final state and the desired goal image.

The energy function `E` is defined as:

```python
def E(s_0, a_0, ..., a_T, s_T):
    similarity = S(s_T, s_goal)
    action_constraints = I(a_t not in A_valid)
    state_constraints = I(s_t not in S_safe)
    return -similarity + sum(action_constraints) + sum(state_constraints)
```

Here, `S` is a perceptual similarity function (e.g., LPIPS or DreamSim) that measures the similarity between the predicted final state `s_T` and the goal image `s_goal`. The indicator functions `I` apply penalties if any action or state constraint is violated, allowing the model to incorporate constraints during planning.

The optimization problem then reduces to finding the sequence of actions `a_0, ..., a_T` that minimizes the energy function `E`. This can be solved using derivative-free optimization techniques, such as the Cross-Entropy Method.

By leveraging this planning approach, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during navigation, surpassing the limitations of fixed-behavior supervised navigation policies. Additionally, NWM can allocate more computational resources to address challenging planning problems, further enhancing its capabilities.

## **Tools and Technologies**

To train and deploy Navigation World Models, the following tools and technologies are utilized:

- **Diffusion Models**: NWM employs diffusion models, a class of generative models that learn to reverse a diffusion process, enabling high-quality image and video synthesis.
- **Transformers**: The Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT) architecture, inspired by the Transformer model, is used to efficiently scale NWM across diverse environments and embodiments.
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: A pre-trained ViT encoder is used to convert input images into latent representations, enabling NWM to operate on compressed latent spaces.
- **Model Optimization**: Techniques like the Cross-Entropy Method are employed for derivative-free optimization, enabling NWM to plan trajectories by minimizing an energy function.
- **Deep Learning Libraries**: Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow are utilized for training and deploying NWM models.
- **Robotics Datasets**: NWM is trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos and navigation actions from robotics datasets such as SCAND, TartanDrive, RECON, and HuRoN, as well as unlabeled data from Ego4D.

## **Mathematical Concepts**

To understand the technical aspects of Navigation World Models, it is essential to have a basic understanding of the following mathematical concepts:

### 1. **Diffusion Process**

In the forward process of diffusion models, noise is added to the target state `s_(τ+1)` according to a randomly chosen timestep `t` from a noise schedule `{α_t}`:

$$
s^{(t)}_{τ+1} = \sqrt{α_t} s_{τ+1} + \sqrt{1 - α_t} \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

*Where:*
- `s^{(t)}_(τ+1)` is the noisy state at timestep `t`,
- `s_(τ+1)` is the original target state,
- `α_t` controls the noise variance, and
- `ε` is Gaussian noise.

### 2. **Denoising Objective**

The goal of the backward process is to recover the original state representations from the noisy version `s^{(t)}_(τ+1)`, conditioned on the context `s_τ`, the current action `a_τ`, and the diffusion timestep `t`. This is achieved by training the model `F_θ` to minimize the mean-squared error between the noisy target `s^{(t)}_(τ+1)` and the predicted target `F_θ(s^{(t)}_(τ+1) | s_τ, a_τ, t)`:

$$
\mathcal{L}_θ = \mathbb{E}_{s_{τ+1}, a_τ, s_τ, \epsilon, t} \left\| s_{τ+1} - F_θ(s^{(t)}_{τ+1} | s_τ, a_τ, t) \right\|^2
$$

By minimizing this loss, the model learns to reconstruct `s_(τ+1)` from `s^{(t)}_(τ+1)` based on the context `s_τ` and the action `a_τ`, enabling it to generate realistic future frames in a sequence.

### 3. **Perceptual Similarity Metrics**

To evaluate the quality of predicted visual representations, perceptual similarity metrics like LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) and DreamSim are used. These metrics compare deep features from pre-trained neural networks, providing a measure of similarity that aligns better with human perception compare
